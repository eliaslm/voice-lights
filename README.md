## **Overview**
This is a demo script for a **Lunch & Learn** session on how to:
- Train a **voice classification model** using [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/).
- Deploy it to a **Nordic Thingy:53**.
- Monitor the model‚Äôs **real-time output**.
- Use the results to **control the lights** in the building via the [Simula Lights API](https://github.com/Northo/simula-lights-api).

The script listens to inference results streamed from `edge-impulse-run-impulse`, detects the most confident class (`off`, `white`, or `yellow`), and adjusts the lights accordingly.

## **Setup**
### Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a FIFO Pipe
We'll use a named pipe to capture the inference output:

```bash
mkfifo inference_pipe
```

### Start Edge Impulse on the Thingy:53
Run this on your machine to stream the inference results:

```bash
edge-impulse-run-impulse | tee inference_pipe
```

### Run the Monitor Script
Run the script with the room number where the lights should be controlled:

```bash
python monitor.py 451
```
Replace 451 with the actual room number.
By default, the script reads from ./inference_pipe, but you can specify a different path:

```bash
python monitor.py 451 --pipe-path /tmp/inference_pipe
```

### What the Script Does
Reads inference results from the FIFO pipe.
Detects whether "off", "white", or "yellow" is the most confident classification.
If confidence is above 0.40, it sends a request to the Simula Lights API:
"off" ‚Üí Turns off the lights.
"white" ‚Üí Sets brightness to 3, then color to 4.
"yellow" ‚Üí Sets brightness to 3, then color to 0.
Ensures that old results don‚Äôt pile up while waiting for the API to respond.

### Simula Lights API
This script interacts with the Simula Lights API.
It sends requests to:

```
Brightness Control: POST /lights/{room}/brightness
Color Control: POST /lights/{room}/color
```

### What This Demo Shows
How to go from training a model to deploying it on hardware.
How to stream and process inference results in real-time.
How to use AI-driven decisions to interact with the physical world.
